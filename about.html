        <p>I am a computer science student with a passion for doing good and helping others - and I firmly believe that love and compassion should drive the work I do. I feel most inspired and challenged by projects where I can apply my skills to help others, and try to approach all problems with this philosophy in mind. Most of my work experience is with small, often non-profit organizations with limited budgets and/or resources, so I am adept in conceiving creative, customized, and accommodating solutions. My main areas of interest are database design and administration, full-stack web development, and site reliability engineering.

            Originally, I never thought I would go into computer science. My interest in it was piqued when I took an introductory engineering course about programming my freshman year, in which we learned basic Matlab and Arduino. The experience of writing code and testing it again and again, seeing the results each time until I was finally successful was what made me fall in love with programming.
