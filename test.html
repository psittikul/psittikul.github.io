            <ul>
                <li>I made my own lightsaber using a broken kyber crystal, which is why it's fiery and unstable - just like my soul.</li>
                <li>I run a popular Twitter page with a massive following.</li>
                <li>I made a guest appearance on SNL.</li>
                <li>Contrary to popular belief, no, this isn't a phase, this is who I am. Why does everyone keep asking me that?</li>

            <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>I was born one year after the Battle of Endor to negligent parents who, despite not being around for most of my life, sure acted like they had a right to tell me who I really am, when they don't. They're not a problem anymore though. Parents: can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em, am I right? Except I can. I can live without them.<br><br>I went through rigorous training, honing my combat skills as well as my use of the Force. I even learned how to make my own lightsaber. Eventually I emerged from the darkness of my formative years and became the Supreme Leader of the First Order.</p>
            <h3>Life at Lehigh</h3>
            <p>After a brief and disastrous time spent learning from my loser scrub of an uncle, I decided to come to Lehigh to develop the skills needed to achieve my dreams: destroying the Resistance and ruling everything. The coursework is also a nice distraction from the constant angst and turmoil I feel raging inside of me.</p>
