            <p>I am a computer science student with a passion for doing good and helping others. I firmly believe that love and compassion should drive the work I do - I feel most inspired and challenged by projects where I can apply my skills to help others, and try to approach all problems with this core philosophy in mind. Most of my work experience is with small, often non-profit organizations with limited budgets and/or resources, so I am adept in conceiving creative, customized, and accommodating solutions. My main areas of interest are database design and administration, full-stack web development, and site reliability engineering.</p>
